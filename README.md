## Loan Formula

    Interest=P × r × t
    
    Where:

    𝑃
        P = Principal (the initial loan amount) = $20,000
    𝑟
        r = Interest rate per period (in decimal form) = 3% = 0.03
    𝑡
        t = Time in years (since interest rate is typically annual, we'll convert months to years) = 3 months = 3/12 = 0.25 years

    So, the interest would be:

    Interest = 20000 × 0.03 × 0.25 = 150
    Interest = 20000 × 0.03 × 0.25 = 150
